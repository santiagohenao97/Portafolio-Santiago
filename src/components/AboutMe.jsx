                I am a developer because it gives me the opportunity to
                integrate technology in all fields and create new solutions that
                change the way things should be done.

                I firmly believe in lifelong learning as a way to change the
                world, that's why I'm always studying about new things. I also love
                teaching and creating a knowledge network that can help other
                people to transform their lives and their environment.
